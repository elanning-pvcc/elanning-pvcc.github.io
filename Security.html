Is it your responsibility to lock your house in such a way that intruders cannot get in, or is it the public’s responsibility to stay out of your house unless invited? Is it the responsibility of an operating system to guard access to a computer and its contents, or is it the responsibility of hackers to leave the machine alone?

This question proposes an interesting problem which most people have thought about if they have looked at cyber security. How much effort or money should I put into protecting myself online and have much value do I have online?

Some people invest into cyber security for two reasons: their perceived value and hacking penalties. There is an idea that has yet to connect with some people and that is every one has some value online whether that is through your work, school, or community resources you have access too. You have something semi unique to offer in the online space and thus have some value to hackers. People also reason that because there are hefty<a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/2012/rpt/2012-r-0254.htm"> penalties</a> for hacking the hacker is able to get equal or greater value out of hacking you.

People who tend to have limited or low online security tend to undervalue themselves online. Because they think they don’t have any value to offer on the online space they think that people would not make the effort to hack them. Another reason people don’t have online protection is a lack of understanding the many ways hackers can infiltrate and manipulate their computer and data.
