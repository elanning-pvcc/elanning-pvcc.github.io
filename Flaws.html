 If a flaw in an operating systemâ€™s security allows a malicious programmer to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, to what extent should the developer of the operating system be held responsible?
 </h2>
 <div style="background-color:grey">
 <p style="color:white;">
 Some people believe that the responsibility relies solely on the developer to make up for their mistake. 
 </p>
 <p style="color:white;">
 Others believe that a large part of the fault is on the developer but to have better system protection the user is required to help with security. Developers are constantly finding flaws in their design and they take those bugs and send out a patch note fix. If people do not update their computer with the latest system the blame will also fall on the user.
